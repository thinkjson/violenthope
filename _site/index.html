        <h1>What's the use?</h1>
        <p>I've asked myself that question a lot over the course of my life. Most people who have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts have. I found an answer, and I want to share it with you.</p>

<p>It all started when I was very young. My Dad basically put me on the bus for the first day of school, then packed up and left. It’s not like I never saw him again, but it didn’t matter. He wasn’t in my life like he was before. I felt alone, abandoned. As a victim of divorce, I felt it was my fault, my dad’s fault, everyone’s fault. I was lost and confused, and just ached inside.</p>

<p>I had a very rocky relationship with my father throughout my childhood. I almost never talked to him, and when I did (mostly at holidays), there was very little dialogue. Now don’t get me wrong, divorce is a terrible thing. It destroys families, and leaves a hole in the heart of everyone involved. However, my Dad was not responsible for the bitterness, hatred, and unforgiveness I held onto for all those years. Sometimes I would go off by myself just to scream, like the demoniac that Jesus encountered in Geneseret - cutting himself and howling at the rocks. I was in a jail of my own making, and it was killing me.</p>

<p>High school just intensified the inner conflict. The stress of being in the <a href="http://www.ibo.org/">International Baccalaureate program</a> was overwhelming, and I found myself sleeping 3 1/2 hours per night just to keep up with my homework and extracirricular activities. I hated life, and every free moment, I found myself dwelling on how to end it all.</p>

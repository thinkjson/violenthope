## Where did this emptiness come from?

It all started when I was very young. My Dad basically put me on the bus for the first day of school, then packed up and left. It's not like I never saw him again, but it didn't matter. He wasn't in my life like he was before. I felt alone, abandoned. As a victim of divorce, I felt it was my fault, my dad's fault, everyone's fault. I was lost and confused, and just ached inside.

I had a very rocky relationship with my father throughout my childhood. I almost never talked to him, and when I did (mostly at holidays), there was very little dialogue. Now don't get me wrong, divorce is a terrible thing. It destroys families, and leaves a hole in the heart of everyone involved. However, my Dad was not responsible for the bitterness, hatred, and unforgiveness I held onto for all those years. Sometimes I would go off by myself just to scream, like the demoniac that Jesus encountered in Genesaret - cutting himself and howling at the rocks. I was in a jail of my own making, and it was killing me.

High school just intensified the inner conflict. The stress of being in the [International Baccalaureate program](http://www.ibo.org/) was overwhelming. I found myself sleeping 3 1/2 hours per night just to keep up with my homework and extracurricular activities. I hated life, and every free moment I found myself dwelling on how to end it all. By the time I entered college, I was regularly planning my own suicide. When it was all said and done, I attempted suicide thirteen times and never left a note.

## What changed?

Each and every time I tried to kill myself, the voice of the Holy Spirit would overwhelm my heart. One time I tried to swallow a bottle of Tylenol. I got eight down before I started choking and gagging, and ended up vomiting. As I sat on our dorm bathroom floor and cried, the Holy Spirit spoke to me with words of comfort and love, which I wholeheartedly rejected. A few weeks later, I was walking across the north bridge in West Palm Beach at three in the morning. Stopping to look around, I saw that there was no one on the bridge and decided this was the perfect time to end it. I climbed up onto the railing and was about to jump when I heard a voice shouting behind me, "Hey! What do you think you're doing!?" I turned around to see a police officer running towards me. I quickly jumped back onto the bridge and made up some lame excuse, then hurriedly walked off the bridge. When I was clear of the bridge, I looked back, and didn't see the officer, or his squad car. I still wonder if an angel saved my life that night.

After failing to kill myself the thirteenth time, I threw the knife into a wall and cried out to the Lord. I told Him I was mad at Him for not letting me kill myself. I told him that if He would bring someone across my path to be a lifeline, that I would let Him heal whatever was making me feel like this, but if He wouldn't, I would end it all for good. I ran out into the quad in the center of campus and just sat down. For almost an hour I watched the student body walk around me while I plotted my next suicide attempt. Then something happened that changed my destiny forever. Someone cared enough to go out of their way and ask me how I was doing. "Fine," I retorted. She pressed the issue, and insisted I come with her to visit her mentor, a Christian mental health counselor at our university.

That day I enrolled in an inner healing group. Through a sixteen week course I learned that the root cause of my depression and suicidal thoughts was unforgiveness towards my father, and that as long as I harbored bitterness towards him I would be drinking the poison that was killing my soul. At the end of that course I made a choice to forgive my father - a choice that I still have to be intentional about. I started a journey of healing that I'm still going through today - not so much healing from the effects of my parents divorce, but from the living hell that I put myself through as a result. I also made a choice to love my heavenly Father, who had been so patient with me in bringing life from death in my heart.

## How can a Christian be suicidal?

The flannel board faith of my childhood couldn't prepare me for the real pain that exists in the world. Crappy things happen to us in this life. The answer is NOT to just suck it up and keep on moving. It was that kind of attitude that kept me imprisoned for so long. As human beings, we are made to feel, to love, to be loved, and to enjoy our lives. When things are out of whack due to our circumstances, even a Christian can forget what this life is all about.

The truth is, hard times come to us all. If you're struggling with suicidal thoughts, it's because you think the crappy things that are happening to you are inescapable, and that there's no one that really understands. The truth is quite the opposite. No matter how bad things are right now - marital problems, financial problems, abuse, neglect, mental imbalance, whatever - there is a Healer that wants to provide a way of escape. Moreover, He understands better than you do what you're going through, and He's longing to help you.

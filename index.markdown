## Where did this emptiness come from?

It all started when I was very young. My Dad basically put me on the bus for the first day of school, then packed up and left. It's not like I never saw him again, but it didn't matter. He wasn't in my life like he was before. I felt alone, abandoned. As a victim of divorce, I felt it was my fault, my dad's fault, everyone's fault. I was lost and confused, and just ached inside.

I had a very rocky relationship with my father throughout my childhood. I almost never talked to him, and when I did (mostly at holidays), there was very little dialogue. Now don't get me wrong, divorce is a terrible thing. It destroys families, and leaves a hole in the heart of everyone involved. However, my Dad was not responsible for the bitterness, hatred, and unforgiveness I held onto for all those years. Sometimes I would go off by myself just to scream, like the demoniac that Jesus encountered in Geneseret - cutting himself and howling at the rocks. I was in a jail of my own making, and it was killing me.

High school just intensified the inner conflict. The stress of being in the [International Baccalaureate program](http://www.ibo.org/) was overwhelming, and I found myself sleeping 3 1/2 hours per night just to keep up with my homework and extracirricular activities. I hated life, and every free moment, I found myself dwelling on how to end it all.
